# Construct

The BOXCAR can be likened to Shopify, the basic ecommerce engine anyone can build a storefront upon. In our case, an NFT business model. Our goal is to build a composable software framework. One that considers all the elements needed for a full range of NFT business types and accounts for explicitly evaluating all the fundamental requirements of NFT use cases. No small task, but we will build in stages.

This means looking closely at the 42 Catalyst proposals who mention NFTs and determining what the common features and functions are. It also means we research the dozens of NFT marketplaces, tools and techniques that are operating on other blockchains and determine what are common features and functions in the competitive landscape as well. Gathering all this information is the initial task we will accomplish.

Added to that information, we can include the unique opportunities Cardano technology allows us to do that other blockchains can’t. Combining all of this information into robust requirements will allow us to design an architecture for the BOXCAR that everyone will need to for building NFT businesses on Cardano expeditiously. We’ll have a very good start for a minimum viable product \(MVP\).

We already understand certain core services or transactions we will need to build, and engineers are already designing user stories, UML flows and wireframes for reviews and sprints to occur in parallel with the research.
