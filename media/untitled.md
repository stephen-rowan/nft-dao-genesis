## Cardano Podcast - Episode 9 - Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab

On this episode I had a chat with the team behind the proposal called Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab. We sat down and discussed Non Fungible Tokens. During the interview we talked about the different use cases, where they are at the moment, the bigger picture and much more.
